Visually displays the processes of various graph based algorithms

Algorithms To be Implemented:
Prims'
Kruskal's
Dijkstra's
BFS
DFS

Note: As stated above this is a work in progress. Also, the program
is not meant to utilize the java 2D api to its fullest. The purpose of
this program is for me to learn how to use the Java 2D api and to show
my understanding of graph theory.
